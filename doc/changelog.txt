Version 20231101
This is a major update with two new important features:
* Nested dissection ordering added. The novel nested dissection ordering method produces much fewer fill-ins and operations than minimum degree variants for post-layout/mesh-like circuits. It also produces fewer operations than METIS on average.
* Support for CSR with duplicated entries added.

Version 20230325
* Fixed a bug in fast factorization
* Added two high-level functions that heuristically determine fast factorization and parallel solving
* Added CKTSO_CreateSolverNoCheck that does not check the supportability of FMA and AVX2,  which can be used on virtual machines
* Added two arguments to CKTSO_SolveMV that represent the leading dimensions
* Reduced latency for CKTSO_CreateSolver
* Updated static pivoting algorithms

Version 20230203
* Added an input parameter iparm[14] (timeout value of threads exiting)
* Added an error code -13 (resource leak)

Version 20221230
* A wrapper is added for languages that do not have pointers to pointers
* Fixed a small glitch (no impact on result correctness)

Version 20221214
* Native support for complex matrices is added (also for CKTSO-GPU), interface changed

Version 20221207
* Modified selection method of row/column mode (for some simulators that require solve and tsolve at the same time), interface changed

Version 20221201
* Calculation of determinant is added

Version 20221123
* GPU acceleration module is added. Please visit https://github.com/chenxm1986/cktso-gpu
* A transposed mode is added (for GPU acceleration of column-order stored matrices)
* Support for multiple right-side vectors is added
