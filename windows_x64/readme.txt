These libraries can be used on Windows systems later than Windows Vista. From Windows 8, Windows introduces a set of new APIs, WaitOnAddress/WakeByAddressSingle/WakeByAddressAll, for thread synchronization. They provide better performance than conventional high-level APIs. The libraries can automatically detect whether the new APIs exist and use them. On Windows 7, the libraries use conventional APIs instead.
